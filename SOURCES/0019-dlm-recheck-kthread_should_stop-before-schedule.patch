Subject: [PATCH 19/19] dlm: recheck kthread_should_stop() before schedule()

Call schedule() here could make the thread miss wake
up from kthread_stop(), so it is better to recheck
kthread_should_stop() before call schedule(), a symptom
happened when I run indefinite test (which mostly created
clustered raid1, assemble it in other nodes, then stop
them) of clustered raid.

$ ps aux|grep md|grep D
root      4211  0.0  0.0  19760  2220 ?        Ds   02:58   0:00 mdadm -Ssq

do_vfs_ioctl+0x96/0x5b0
SyS_ioctl+0x79/0x90
entry_SYSCALL_64_fastpath+0x1e/0xad

This maybe not resolve the issue completely since the
KTHREAD_SHOULD_STOP flag could be set between "break"
and "schedule", but at least the chance for the symptom
happen could be reduce a lot (The indefinite test runs
more than 20 hours without problem and it happens easily
without the change).
